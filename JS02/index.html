  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>
  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>I'm not 100% sure on much about JavaScript right now, but here goes. It seems alert() is       used more to draw attention to the user on something and console.log() is just used to         print something to the console.</p>
  
  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an alert() to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>Possibly to alert the user that a payment has posted on an account?</p>
  
  <h2>What's one way that alert() might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>I'm not sure yet. I'll have to come back to this question later.</p>
  
  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>

  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  
  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets              displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)?            After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out          for sure?</h2>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
